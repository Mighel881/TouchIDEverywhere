Known issues
-------------------------
- Doesn't work on UIWebView forms
- May accidentally recognize other text fields as a username
- Uhh there was something else but I forgot...

TODO: 
- Obviously, fix known issues
- Options: enable switch, auto press enter, don't fill usernames
- some sort of glow or animation on the current field to make it obvious (other than the cursor)
